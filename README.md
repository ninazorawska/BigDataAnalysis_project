# BigDataAnalysis_project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end capabilities of Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, analysis, and machine learning.
Using multiple real-world datasets - including the Wine Quality dataset and others — we explore how Spark can efficiently handle diverse analytical workloads, from raw data ingestion to predictive modeling and visualization.
The goal of the project is to showcase a complete Big Data pipeline that integrates several components of the Spark ecosystem:
 - RDDs for low-level data manipulation and transformations
 - DataFrames & SparkSQL for structured analytics and SQL-based querying
 - Pipelines & Data Engineering for feature preprocessing and model automation
 - Machine Learning (Spark MLlib) for classification and regression tasks
 - GraphFrames for graph-based data relationships and network insights
 - MongoDB integration for real-time and persistence extensions

By combining multiple datasets — such as chemical properties of wines, flight connections & delays and heart failure data - the project highlights Spark’s flexibility across different data domains.
The resulting pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks), along with interpretability analysis and cross-dataset insights.
